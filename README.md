 🔑 How to Get Your Discord Channel ID

To get the **Channel ID**, follow these steps:
you can get the Channel ID directly from the URL of the channel:

1. Go to the channel in your browser.
2. Copy the **Channel ID** from the URL. It’s the second part of the URL after `/channels/`.
   - Example URL: `https://discord.com/channels/948033443483254845/1027161980970205225`
   - **Channel ID**: `1027161980970205225`

Copy the **Channel ID** and paste it into your `.env` file or wherever you need it in your bot configuration.


### **4.(Optional) Customize Personal Info**
   Edit `myinfo.txt` to add your personal data (e.g., name, hobbies, favorite phrases) for more personalized replies.
   For each bot account, create a separate info file:
- `myinfo.txt` (for account 1)
- `myinfo2.txt` (for account 2)
- `myinfo3.txt` (for account 3)

## ▶️ Usage

To run the bot:
```bash
python bot.py
```

The bot will quietly monitor your Discord messages and respond where appropriate based on your settings.

### Use Case: Level Up for Airdrops
One of the common use cases for this bot is **leveling up in Discord servers**. Many **airdrops** or events require users to gain levels or activity in certain Discord servers. By using the **Mee6 bot** or similar bots that track activity, you can **automatically generate messages** and **interact in channels**, helping you level up faster without manual input.

With the **Gemini AI-powered responses**, the bot can interact naturally in servers, completing tasks such as:
- Participating in chat and events.
- Responding to messages or mentions.
- Completing simple tasks that would otherwise require manual input.

This makes the **Discord Gemini Chat Bot** a powerful tool for automating your Discord experience and enhancing your **airdrops strategy** or **server activities**.
